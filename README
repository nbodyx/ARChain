# PLEASE read these expalantions and ALSO look the comments in the code.

## FIRST DATA LINE: 

 UNITS: G=1,  I usually use Solar masses, astronomical units (AU), then the time is such that:  1 Year=2 Pi, i.e. years=time/twopi

 IWR =output index (the larger the more diagnostic output)

 N=number of bodies

 DELTAT = (approx) output interval

 TMAX =maximum time

 step = initial stepsize  (if step=0, the code attempts to estimate a reasonable one), NORMALLY =0

 soft = softening (code works best for soft=0, but softening is not prohibited), NORMALLY = 01

 cmet =three-dimesional vector that defines the used time-transformation  1 0 0 may usually be the best
         (but a small value for cmet(2) may be advisable in case of star-star near collision).

 Clight= speed of light. The code system of units is such that G=1. If AU and M_sun are =1, then CLIGHT \approx 10^4.

 outfile= name of outputfile for time and coords

 IXC= index that tels if exact output times are required, 
      0 => no exact, output when t>tnext, (fast, but sometimes output interval too long) 
      1 => exact time (not always accureate, but faster than the exact iteration)
      2 => exact iteration (time to tnext) (slower!)

 NBH= number of black holes, (which MUST be the bodies # 1,2,.., NBH)

 spin= three-dimensional vector= the (relative) spin of the BH = M1 (i.e. |psin|<1, and only the first body 
       is allowed to be a Kerr-hole, other possible BH's are non-rotating).
 
 EPS = error tolerance for the integration

 ivelocity = index telling that there are v-dependent perturbations (=1) or not (=0)

 KSMX = tells how many (maximum) integration steps the code is at most allowd to take between outputs 
        (this avoidsi almost infinity loops is step has got an unreasonably small valuei, from which it may not recover)

## ---------   END OF FIRST DATA LINE EXPLANATION ----------------

 AFTER the first line of data there is the list of masses and initial conditions
    m x y z  vx vy vz
 for all the bodies from 1 to N.


## ------------------------------------------------------------

 After finishin one simulation the code attempt to read data for the next one.
 It stops when the 1. line is zeros (actually if N<2).

# OUTPUT: (at the moment)

The coordinates goto the OUTPUT file (coords for merged bodies get huge values for moviei/picture makingi i.e. they go out of figure)  
        write(66,234)time,
     & (xwr(k),xwr(k+1),xwr(k+2),k=1,3*n_ini,3)

In addition orbital elements (Keplerian ones) are written to files 71, 72,.. 75 as explaned here:
           write(71,171)time,(ai(k),k=2,N_ini) ! a   write orbital elements (with respect to M1)
           write(72,171)time,(ei(k),k=2,N_ini) ! e
           write(73,171)time,(unci(k),k=2,N_ini) ! i
           write(74,171)time,(Omi(k),k=2,N_ini)  ! \Omega
           write(75,171)time,(ooi(k),k=2,N_ini)  ! \omega
           write(76,*)time,spin,dsp ! spin(k), k=1,3 of M1  (|spin|<1),
                                    ! dsp is error in the length of the spin vector
 

 One may change the main program easily to get other quantities computed from the coords/vels that 'ARC' returns.
 Note that the number of bodies may change if the BH swollows some of them.
